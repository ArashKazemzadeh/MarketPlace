# Market Place Project

This project is a web-based market place that includes three roles: seller, buyer, and admin. Sellers can create stalls with various categorized products and upload their images. They can set the selling price as fixed or run an auction for a specific period. The highest bidder wins the auction, and if no one bids, the product becomes inactive. The seller pays a commission to the site for each sale, which decreases with increasing sales and when reaching a certain amount on all products. Sellers can also edit their profile information.

Buyers can browse through specific categories of sellers or sellers' stalls and purchase products at a fixed price or bid in an auction. They can view the latest bid prices, and after purchasing, leave a feedback for the seller. Buyers can also check their purchase history and edit their profile information.

The admin verifies and approves products uploaded by sellers and feedback left by buyers. They can view all registered products, delete or edit user profiles, shops, and categories. Admins can also monitor the commission earned from sales.
